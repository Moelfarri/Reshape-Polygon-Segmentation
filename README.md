# Reshape-Polygon-Segmentation
This algorithm uses OpenCV to demonstrate an example of how to let a user reshape a segmented polygon to their liking, if they are not happy with their initial segmentation whether the initial segmentation is done initially manually, by using a deep learning segmentation algorithm or some other traditional computer vision methods (edge detection, watershed segmentation etc). This algorithm is therefore supposed to supply the initial segmentation step so that the result is not completely thrown away.
